# Library_Management_System_Desktop_Application

The library management system is a software application developed using Java Swing and AWT libraries. It utilizes the JDBC driver to connect to a MySQL database for storing and managing library-related data.

This system allows librarians to efficiently manage various library tasks, including book inventory management, student information management, book issuing and returning, and generating reports.

With the help of a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI), librarians can perform tasks such as adding new books to the library, updating book details, registering new students, issuing books to students, and receiving returned books. The system also provides features for searching and filtering books, tracking book due dates, and managing fines or penalties.

The integration of the JDBC driver enables seamless connectivity to a MySQL database, allowing real-time data storage and retrieval. This ensures accurate and up-to-date information is available to library staff and students.

Overall, the library management system streamlines library operations, improves efficiency, and enhances the overall library experience for both librarians and library users.
